# get_next_line

## Overview

The `get_next_line` project is part of the 42 Core Curriculum. The objective is to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it. This project helps in understanding file handling, memory management, and efficient reading techniques in C.

## Objectives

- Implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor.
- Handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Efficiently manage memory and handle edge cases like end-of-file (EOF) and errors.

## Function Prototype

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
