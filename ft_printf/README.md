# ft_printf

## Overview

The `ft_printf` project is part of the 42 Core Curriculum. The objective is to recreate the C library function `printf`. This project enhances your understanding of variadic functions, formatted output, and handling various data types and edge cases in C.

## Objectives

- Implement a versatile `ft_printf` function that handles various format specifiers.
- Gain a deep understanding of variadic functions and how to manage them.
- Ensure the function behaves similarly to the standard `printf` function, including edge cases and error handling.

## Function Prototype

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
